# E-Commerce API Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Building a comprehensive e-commerce API with JWT authentication, product management, shopping cart functionality, and Stripe payment gateway integration using MySQL as the database.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Architecture

### Directory Structure
- Set up the project structure as outlined previously
- Configure environment variables for sensitive information
- Implement versioning via URL paths (`/api/v1/...`)

### Database Design
- Create MySQL database schemas for:
  - Users (id, name, email, password, role, created_at)
  - Products (id, name, description, price, inventory, category, images, created_at)
  - Carts (id, user_id, created_at)
  - Cart_Items (id, cart_id, product_id, quantity)
  - Orders (id, user_id, status, total, payment_intent_id, created_at)
  - Order_Items (id, order_id, product_id, quantity, price)

### Security Setup
- Configure security headers
- Set up CORS policies
- Implement rate limiting
- Configure input validation middleware

## Phase 2: Authentication System

### Features
- User registration with email validation
- User login with JWT token generation
- Refresh token implementation
- Password reset functionality
- Role-based access control (user vs admin)

### Security Measures
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT with short expiration
- Secure HTTP-only cookies for tokens
- Input sanitization

## Phase 3: Product Management

### Features
- Complete CRUD operations for products (admin only)
- Product search with filters (name, category, price range)
- Product inventory management
- Product image handling
- Product pagination and sorting

## Phase 4: Shopping Cart System

### Features
- Create cart for users
- Add products to cart
- Update product quantities
- Remove products from cart
- Calculate cart totals
- Save cart between sessions

## Phase 5: Order & Checkout System

### Features
- Convert cart to order
- Order status tracking
- Order history for users
- Admin order management

## Phase 6: Payment Integration

### Features
- Stripe API integration
- Payment intent creation
- Payment confirmation
- Webhook handling for payment events
- Handling failed payments
- Receipt generation

## Phase 7: Admin Panel API

### Features
- Product management endpoints
- User management endpoints
- Order management endpoints
- Sales analytics endpoints
- Inventory monitoring endpoints

## Phase 8: Testing & Documentation

### Activities
- Unit testing for all components
- Integration testing for key flows
- API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
- Setup documentation for developers

## Phase 9: Deployment & CI/CD

### Activities
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Configure production environment
- Database migration strategy
- Monitoring and logging setup

## Security Best Practices (Throughout)

- Implement input validation on all endpoints
- Use parameterized SQL queries to prevent injection
- Set proper CORS policies
- Implement rate limiting
- Configure security headers
- Secure authentication with JWT
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Implement audit logging
- Regular security testing

## API Versioning Strategy

- URL-based versioning (`/api/v1/...`)
- Clear deprecation policy for future versions
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Documentation for version differences

This comprehensive plan outlines a structured approach to building a secure, scalable e-commerce API that meets all the requirements specified in the project brief, using MySQL as the database and incorporating best practices for API security and versioning.
